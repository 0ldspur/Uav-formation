# UAV Formation Control using MARL

This project explores decentralized formation control for multiple UAVs using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The system is developed using Python and trained in a Gym/PyBullet simulation environment before deployment on Crazyflie drones.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Develop a MARL-based decentralized control system
- Train UAVs in simulation (Gym + PyBullet)
- Transfer trained policies to real-world Crazyflie drones
- Evaluate formation stability and performance

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- PyBullet (for simulation)
- Gym (environment integration)
- Crazyflie (for real-world deployment)
- pycharm
